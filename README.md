## Description:
<p>This SQL project is designed to analyze data related to museums, artists, and artworks. The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle three main tables: artist, work, and museum.</p>


## Project Structure :<br>
1)Database Schema: The project begins with the creation of a suitable database schema to organize the data effectively. Three tables are created: artist, work, and museum, each with appropriate fields to store information about artists, their works, and the museums where the works are displayed.

2)Data Population: After defining the schema, the tables are populated with data extracted from the Kaggle dataset. This step ensures that the database contains relevant information for subsequent analysis.

3)Query Analysis: A series of SQL queries are executed to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. These queries cover a variety of analytical tasks, <br>
<br>

## Questions:<br>
• Retrieving the full names of artists along with the names of the museums where their works are displayed.<br>
• How many works does each artist have in the database? Display the artist's full name along with the count of their works, ordered by the count in descending order.<br>
• List the top 5 museums with the highest number of works displayed in the database, along with their respective counts.<br>
• Display the names and styles of the works along with the corresponding museum names, ordered by the museum name in ascending order. Limit the results to 10.<br>
• Show the total sale price for each artist's works. Display the artist's full name along with the total sale price, ordered by the total sale price in descending order.<br>
• List artists who have more than 3 works in the database, along with the count of their works.<br>
• Retrieving works and their corresponding artists' full names for works with a sale price smaller than their regular price.<br>
• Calculating the average height and width of the artworks in the database.<br>
• Finding the maximum sale price among all works in each museum.<br>
• Concatenating the full name, and nationality of artists along with the count of their works, ordered by the count.
